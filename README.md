# Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer
A simple Python program that visualizes the steps of Bubble Sort and Merge Sort algorithms using matplotlib.

## Features

- Generates random data within a specified range.
- Visualizes the steps of the Bubble Sort and Merge Sort algorithms.
- Allows setting the delay between steps.
- Highlights the current elements being compared or merged.
- Displays the element value of each corresponding bar.
- In the case of Bubble Sort, displays an annotation indicating the current and next values being compared.

## Running the Application
To run the application, execute interface.py
As an example, you might enter the following:

- How many integers do you want to sort? **30**
- Enter the start of the range: **1**
- Enter the end of the range: **100**
- Which sorting algorithm do you want to use? (bubble/merge) **bubble**
- What delay time do you want? **0.1**
